# first-text-adventure

Python, object-oriented text adventure. Still in design, but complete enough to run. Well situated for further content.

Decided to make this an 'escape room' game, much as I hate the type. It's not your normal escape room, so hopefully it's still fun to play.

To run, download "main adventure.py" or copy the text into a local document. Next, run the program with python (If you don't have python, you can download it from python.org, a reputable open-source site). It should open in either Command Prompt or the Python shell, depending on your default program. Either will work.

Enjoy!
