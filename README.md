# first-text-adventure

Python, object-oriented text adventure. Still in design, but complete enough to run. Well situated for further content.

In a burst of creativity or madness, I've decided to base this adventure off of the scene at the end of Roger Zelazny's The Guns of Avalon (Book Two of the Chronicles of Amber). All additions from this point forward will keep this in mind. 

To run, download "main adventure.py" or copy the text into a local document. Next, run the program with python (If you don't have python, you can download it from python.org, a reputable open-source site). It should open in either Command Prompt or the Python shell, depending on your default program. Either will work.

Enjoy!



A note to players who have read Amber in detail (**SPOILERS**): 

I am aware that this game does not exactly match the scene in Guns of Avalon, and that the Pattern in the Amber universe is not a maze. All changes are to make the game more interactive or simpler to code.
